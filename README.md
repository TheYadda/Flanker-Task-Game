# Fleischer-Task-Game
Gamified implementation of the [Eriksen flanker task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriksen_flanker_task) with a theme inspired by 1930s ['rubber hose' animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_hose_animation), created as part of the [UCSD RADLab / PoNG Summer Internship](https://pong-center.ucsd.edu/internship/) in 2020.

This is my personal copy of the repository from after the internship ended; the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/powerofneurogaming/Flanker-Task-Internship), as part of the [Power of NeuroGaming](https://github.com/powerofneurogaming) GitHub organization.

No license or warranty is provided for this code, and it is no longer being maintained. It is only here as an example of my work. This game was created for use at UCSD as an internal research tool; no license is given for you to modify or redistribute this work, as I am unsure of the licensing other than having been given permission by UCSD to rehost it on my personal GitHub.
